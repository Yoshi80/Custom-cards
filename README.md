# Yoshi Duels Custom Cards

#### 1. How to install ? 

 - On the top right corner of the file list, there should be a "Clone or download" button. Click on it, then choose "Download ZIP"
 - Inside the ZIP file, there is a folder. Inside that folder, you'll find the exact same content as the git repository. Those are the files you want to unzip.

#### 2. How to add the cards to my game ?

Simply merge the contents of the pics, script and expansion you've just downloaded with the ones already present in your game folder.
For the archetype names to show up in the editor, also merge the config folder.
If you want some pre-constructed Decks using custom cards, also merge the deck folder.

#### 3. How to play with those cards ?

You can only play thse cards in Hand Test mode, or in LAN mode, **including against the AI** !
For more information on how to play against the AI, please contact the Edopro staff team.

#### 4. I found a bug ! How do I report it ?

If you found a bug, please use GitHub's issue system and describe your problem. If you can, please provide a replay for me to see what the problem is.
As it is common practice on GitHub, **all issues should be made in english** because if some card scripters happen to come by here and wants to help me fix my cards, they're welcome. But if they can't understand the issue, then it's pointless.

#### 5. What about the cover folder ?

This folder contains all covers used for my videos (plus one exclusive), you can use them as textures for your game. In order to do so :
 - Before any manipulation, I strongly advise to go into your ygopro textures folder and copy the cover and cover2 files somewhere else. If you don't, you won't be able to change your cover, should you change your mind.
  - Rename the cover file you want to use as "cover" and the cover file you want your opponent to use as "cover2".
  - Copy those files to your ygopro texture folder, replacing any old one.
